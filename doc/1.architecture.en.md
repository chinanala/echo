# Architecture

[TOC]

The essence of Echo is a distributed message router system implemented by long connection. By maintaining long connection tunnels between all terminal and main server, Echo is capable of sending messages through sockets on different IP addresses. 

On the other way, Echo implement proxy protocols upstream, and transform the protocols to basic assignment in lower level, such as socket connection, massage router, remote shell and so on.

Echo could send a TCP or UDP message from any terminal in system, which makes Echo get positive prospects in IP limited scenarios, such as web-spider application, anti risk control system. 

## 1 Subservice

Echo is modular designed, containing following subservices.

1. EchoClient
2. EchoNatServer
3. EchoHttpProxyServer
4. EchoMetaServer
5. EchoPenetration

### 1.1 EchoClient

EchoClient is deployed on terminals. All messages in Echo are exported by EchoClient. EchoClient could be deployed on multiple devices, such as mobile phone, PC, microcomputers.

#### 1.1.1 Role

1. EchoClient is used as an agent for sending and receiving messages, including TCP/UPD message, and creating TCP/UDP sockets(EchoClient could split and merge the packet on transport layer, without caring the content of packet). 
2. **Long Connection Remaining**. ==With the configuration of Echo center server, EchoClient can connect to Echo center servers by private protocols.== If connections are detected to be disconnected or no response, EchoClient need to reconnect to the Echo center servers. So heartbeat task is implemented in EchoClient.
3. **Remote Control**. Remote Control is defined by private protocol of EchoClient. Center server can send some special task(in string form) to EchoClient in long connection, such as  IP replay, device reboot, file pull request, shell command. The meaning of command are not defined in EchoClient SDK, you are supposed to implement this part task by your command(Some tasks have been packaged in EchoClient on Android to do auto replay under Flight Mode).
4. **Guarantee High-availability of Tunnel Resources**. The connection of EchoClient and center may come out under server offline circumstance. However, in cluster mode, EchoClient will build long connections to at least two center servers. With any crash happen on a center server, EchoClient will proxy the requests through other long connections. 


### 1.1.2 Versions

EchoClient can running on following platforms:

1. JAR(SDK): JAR version is officially supported by Echo. Users can integrate Echo SDK to any environment with secondary development by themselves. But it will be more flexible to develop more custom functions in various circumstances. You can use it in any JAVA projects.
2. Android Application: Android is one of default platform for EchoClient. [Android's EchoClient](https://git.virjar.com/echo/ip-app) is an independent application developed based on SDK. Android's EchoClient could set up a independent export IP for Echo. The application is developed with React Native(RN).To rebuild the application, you need to be ware of RN(or just give it to front-end and Android engineers in your company).
3. Scripts on PC: The script on PC is also secondary developed base on JAR SDK, runs on JVM. For the feature of JAVA, script support Windows, MAC, Linux platform. It will fit on platforms automatically, and deploy itself as a daemon and power boot script.
4. C++ version(undeveloped): The C++ version of Echo is developed with `libevent` library as a multi-platform SDK. This SDK branch have batter adaptation on different platforms. However, it's also more difficult to maintain for C++ environment. C++ version can embed Raspberry Pi, router and so on, is more fit to foul environment.

Except for the C++ version SDK is under developing, the others are all developed.

## 1.2 EchoNatServer

EchoNatServer is a middle ware of Echo. Its main function is NAT traversal, maintaining the tunnel to EchoClient. EchoClient can map it port as a addressable port on Echo center server. All packets EchoNatServer send to the port will be replayed on EchoClient concurrently, while all packets EchoClient get will be send back to EchoNatServer. EchoNatServer belong to inner resource of Echo. In consideration of the influence of bandwidth, CPU and consistency of system, EchoNatServer should be deployed on multiple nodes. When a small amount of EchoNatServer nodes are offline, Echo could still run normally.

EchoNatServer nodes are managed by EchoMetaServer, sending their configurations, resource mapping, client resource to EchoMetaServer. As service supplier, EchoNatServer nodes will build long connections to EchoClient nodes. 

On the other hand, EchoNatServer set up a inner session layer in Echo (similar to SSL) to supply private protocols. EchoHttpProxyServer is programed basing on this layer.

According to sever layers in OSI, EchoNatServer works on the sixth layer (session layer). In theory, EchoNatServer can be a proxy to any TCP/UDP object. It could even supply proxy service to new protocols based on UDP (such as HTTP 3.0) by secondary programing theoretically. The solution of HTTP 3.0 proxy is not developed yet. But we can easily build a client private protocols towards HTTP 3.0 by Echo.

## 1.3 EchoHttpProxyServer

EchoHttpProxyServer is the implement of HTTP proxy protocol. EchoHttpProxyServer implement HTTP proxy in front end, connecting to EchoNatServer from back end. User authentication, traffic control, HTTP/HTTPS/Socket proxy are implemented in EchoHttpProxyServer.

Auto Scaling is also supported by EchoHttpProxyServer. You can deploy several EchoHttpProxyServer node to increase system performance and task apportionment ability under high concurrency circumstance. 


## 1.4 EchoMetaServer

As the core of Echo, all meta data are managed in EchoMetaServer. User login info, device info, proxy resources are recorded by MYSQL in EchoMetaServer. EchoMetaServer can be access by HTTP requests, which make it can do load balance through Nginx. Front End of EchoMetaServer are implemented by React Native. Main page of website is exactly supplied by subservice of EchoMetaServer. 

The core service of EchoMetaServer is manage EchoNatServer, EchoHttpProxyServer and EchoClient. Each EchoHttpProxyServer node will map a EchoNatServer and a EchoClient in a proxy tunnel, while two EchoHttpProxyServer nodes and two EchoNatServer nodes should be mapped to one EchoClient node. All these mapping relations in Echo are calculated and managed by EchoMetaServer.

On the other hand, for less time delay, EchoMetaServer are designed to be data management server, forward flow should not be processed on EchoMetaServer. EchoMetaServer will manage other modules just in asynchronous way or heartbeat packets.


## 1.5 EchoPenetration

EchoPenetration runs on the same layer with EchoHttpProxyServer, mapping the inner port to the internet. Same as `FRP`, `Ngrok`, `TeamViewer`, EchoPenetration can map the service of internal network(such as company intranet, family network, campus network) to Echo center server. It will be available for you to access the restricted service. It could usually be used in following scenarios:

1. I build a website on my personal computer, linking on family network. I hope that it can be accessed from the Internet, while I have no server on the Internet.
2. I've assembled an awesome PC in home, which could be much helpful to AI training, vision computing. I want to access the computing resource from arbitrary place outside.
3. Some GPUs are deployed in my school lab. I want to want to access them from my home on vacation.
4. I can download the papers freely on IPs belonging to campus network, while I have no access to these paper databases from family network on my vacation.
5. When I want to do some work from home,some APIs built on company's intranet could not be accessed from my personal environment.
6. I want to control my family computer(such as telnet, RDP) from remote.

EchoPenetration is a series of protocols implemented basing on EchoNatServer, playing nearly the same role with EchoHttpProxyServer.

## 1.6 Modules Flow Chart

### 1.6.1 Register Client

Before registered in Echo system, EchoClient(scripts on PC, embedded SDK, applications) need to login first. The main purpose of register is negotiating the allocation of EchoNatServer and EchoMetaServer resources to Echo. In register part, EchoClient will communicate with Echo through HTTP connection, and get a token from EchoMetaServer.

Then EchoClient pulls configuration of EchoNatServer from EchoMetaServer. EchoMetaServer will send the host-port info of EchoNatServer back to corresponding `ClientID`.

According to host-port list, EchoClient set up long connection with servers through EchoNatServer. Then servers are registered in Echo. EchoClient will take following forwarding tasks.

### 1.6.2 Start inner proxy by EchoNatServer

After the connection between EchoNatServer and EchoClient are set, EchoNatServer will open a listening port on server. This port will bind the only Client, then Echo get a inner private proxy and EchoNatServer will push this news to EchoMetaServer. EchoMetaServer will register this port and the resource of EchoNatServer, then admins will see this online resource from Echo backend.

### 1.6.3 Start proxy service by EchoHttpProxyServer

According to `ServerID` of EchoHttpProxyServer, EchoMetaServer can get new EchoNatServer ports resource configuration from EchoMetaServer by crontabs. EchoMetaServer will allocate resource in this part to make resources are going to be actually used by EchoHttpProxyServer.

After pulling EchoNatServer resources from EchoMetaServer, EchoHttpProxyServer will open a HTTP/HTTPS/Sockets port for every EchoClient, which need to be mapped at first. EchoMetaServer will send these messages to database. EchoHttpProxyServer front end will implement a normal proxy protocol, while EchoHttpProxyServer back end will have a handshake process with EchoNatServer and begin to forward traffic. 

### 1.6.4 Send IP configurations to Users

After proxy service online, all proxy IP configurations are recorded in EchoMetaServer databases. When users need some proxy resources, they can get resources from HTTP API or back end website. Then they can use it in their own website, code projects, mobile phones. This part is a basic flow about how to use IP resource, and you can find demos from all IP suppliers. 

### 1.6.5 Sending and Receiving on proxy of Users

In the actual scenarios of Echo, when HTTP packets are sent to Echo, EchoHttpProxyServer will get handshake request at first. After the requests are received, a new tunnel will be built toward server, using Echo private protocols.

When HTTP/HTTPS requests from user are received, with the tunnel between EchoHttpProxyServer and EchoNatServer, requests will be send directly to EchoNatServer. And EchoNatServer will send it to its only mapped EchoClient. The reverse flow happens when the response packets are sent to users.
